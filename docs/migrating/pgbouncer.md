Migrating from PgBouncer is straight forward once a Supavisor cluster is setup and a database has been added as a `tenant`.

No application level code changes should be required other than a connection string change. Both `transaction` and `session` pool mode behavior for Supavisor is the same as PgBouncer.

One caveat during migration is running two connection poolers at the same time.

When rolling out a connection string change to your application you will momentarily need to support two connection pools to Postgres.

## Check Postgres connection limit

Lets see what our connection limit is set to on our Postgres database:

```sql
show max_connections;
```

## Check used connections

Lets see how many connections we're currently using:

```sql
select count(*) from pg_stat_activity;
```

## Change Postgres `max_connections`

Based on the responses above configure the `default_pool_size` accordingly or increase your `max_connections` limit on Postgres to accomadate two connection poolers.

e.g if you're using 30 connections out of 100 and you set your `default_pool_size` to 20 you have enough connections to run a new Supavisor pool along side your PgBouncer pool.

If you are using 90 connections out of 100 and your `default_pool_size` is set to 20 you will have problems during the deployment of your Supavisor connection string because you will hit your Postgres `max_connections` limit.

## Verify Supavisor connections

Once we've got Supavisor started we can verify it's using the amount of connections we set for `default_pool_size`:

```sql
select
  count(*) as count,
  usename,
  application_name
from pg_stat_activity
where application_name ilike '%Supavisor%'
group by
  usename,
  application_name
order by application_name desc;
```

## Celebrate!

You deserve it ðŸ¤™
