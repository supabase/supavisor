The metrics feature provides a range of metrics in the Prometheus format. The
main modules involved in this implementation are:

- `Supavisor.Monitoring.PromEx`
- `Supavisor.PromEx.Plugins.OsMon`
- `Supavisor.PromEx.Plugins.Tenant`
- `Supavisor.Monitoring.Telem`

## Endpoint

To use the metrics feature, send an HTTP request to the `/metrics` endpoint. The
endpoint is secured using Bearer authentication, which requires a JSON Web Token
(JWT) generated using the `METRICS_JWT_SECRET` environment variable. Make sure
to set this environment variable with a secure secret key.

When a node receives a request for metrics, it polls all nodes in the cluster,
accumulates their metrics, and appends service tags such as region and host. To
generate a valid JWT, use a library or tool that supports JWT creation with the
HS256 algorithm and the `METRICS_JWT_SECRET` as the secret key.

Remember to keep the `METRICS_JWT_SECRET` secure and only share it with
authorized personnel who require access to the metrics endpoint.

### Filtered per tenant

Metrics endpoints filtered for specific tenants are available at their own
endpoints:

```
/metrics/:external_id
```

## System, VM & application metrics

The exposed metrics include the following:

- Application
- BEAM
- Phoenix
- Ecto
- System monitoring metrics:
  * CPU utilization
  * RAM usage
  * Load average (LA)

## Tenant metrics

Supavisor also tags many metrics with the `tenant` `external_id` so you can
drill down to metrics per tenant:

- Pool checkout queue time
- Number of connected clients
- Query duration and query counts
- Network usage for client sockets and database sockets
